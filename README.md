# Netflix Watching Habits Analysis

## Description
This project analyzes my Netflix watching habits to identify patterns and trends over time. The primary focus is to investigate how my watching behavior changes during exam periods compared to regular times. Using my watching hours as the main data, the project aims to uncover insights about my routines and assess their alignment with my academic responsibilities.

## Hypothesis
My hypothesis is that my Netflix watching hours significantly decrease during exam periods, reflecting a shift in focus toward studying.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this project is twofold:
- To better understand how I balance my time between fun and studying.
- To assess whether my habits align with my goals for productivity, especially during exams periods.

## Data Source
The primary data source for this project is my Netflix watching history, specifically the hours spent watching content over time. This data will be categorized and analyzed based on:
- Time periods (regular days vs. exam periods)
- Watching hours segmented by day and time
- Genre preferences and other relevant metadata, if available

## Data Analysis Plan
1. **Data Cleaning**:
   - Import and preprocess the Netflix watching history data.
   - Filter and organize the data to focus on relevant attributes (e.g., watching hours, timestamps).

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualize overall trends in watching habits over time.
   - Compare daily, weekly, and monthly watching hours.

3. **Exam Period Analysis**:
   - Define and isolate exam periods in the data.
   - Analyze differences in watching hours during these periods compared to regular days.

4. **Statistical Testing**:
   - Conduct hypothesis testing to evaluate whether the difference in watching hours during exam periods is statistically significant.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Create charts and graphs (e.g., time-series plots, heatmaps) to illustrate findings clearly.
